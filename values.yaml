# Per-Application Policy Gating Documentation:
#
# POLICY GATING OVERVIEW:
# BD SelfScan now supports per-application policy enforcement via the applications.yaml configuration.
# This allows different applications to have different security requirements while maintaining 
# a single scanning infrastructure.
#
# CONFIGURATION FIELDS (in applications.yaml):
#   policyGating: true/false         - Enable/disable policy enforcement for this application
#   policyGatingRisk: "BLOCKER,..."  - Comma-separated severity levels that cause failures
#
# ENFORCEMENT MODES:
#   Discovery Mode (policyGating: false):
#     - Scans always succeed regardless of findings
#     - All vulnerabilities reported to Black Duck for visibility
#     - Perfect for legacy systems, testing, or initial rollout
#   
#   Enforcement Mode (policyGating: true):
#     - Scans can fail on policy violations
#     - Build/deployment blocked when violations found
#     - Granular control via policyGatingRisk setting
#
# POLICY SEVERITY LEVELS:
#   BLOCKER   - Must fix immediately (all tiers should include)
#   CRITICAL  - High-severity vulnerabilities (tier 1-3)
#   HIGH      - Important security issues (tier 1-2)
#   MEDIUM    - Moderate concerns (tier 1 only)
#   LOW       - Minor issues (rarely used for blocking)
#   TRIVIAL   - Informational (rarely used for blocking)
#
# RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATIONS BY TIER:
#   Tier 1 (Critical):    policyGating: true, policyGatingRisk: "BLOCKER,CRITICAL,HIGH"
#   Tier 2 (High):        policyGating: true, policyGatingRisk: "BLOCKER,CRITICAL"  
#   Tier 3 (Medium):      policyGating: true, policyGatingRisk: "BLOCKER,CRITICAL"
#   Tier 4 (Low):         policyGating: false (discovery mode)
#
# MIGRATION STRATEGY:
#   Week 1-2: All applications with policyGating: false (discovery mode)
#   Week 3-4: Non-critical apps with policyGating: true, policyGatingRisk: "BLOCKER"
#   Week 5+:  Gradually tighten policies based on application criticality
#
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION:
# applications:
#   - name: "Payment API"
#     namespace: "payments"
#     labelSelector: "app=payment-api"
#     policyGating: true                    # Enable enforcement
#     policyGatingRisk: "BLOCKER,CRITICAL" # Block on these severities
#     projectGroup: "Financial Services"
#     projectTier: 1
#     description: "Critical payment processing with strict enforcement"

#   - name: "Admin Tools"
#     namespace: "admin"
#     labelSelector: "app=admin-dashboard"
#     policyGating: false                   # Discovery mode
#     policyGatingRisk: ""                  # Ignored when gating disabled
#     projectGroup: "Internal Tools"
#     projectTier: 4
#     description: "Internal tools in discovery mode"
